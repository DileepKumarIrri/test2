## Observational and causal learning

How do we learn causal relations in the world? How can methods in AI and machine learning perform causal reasoning tasks at the same level we do? The field of causal inference deals with how the effect of interventions on the world can be predicted from observation. Today, most state-of-the-art AI agents are trained via reinforcement learning, in which an agent learns directly from the consequences of its own actions -- it learns about causal relations direct from intervention. Yet humans (and arguably some primates) can also learn about what will happen if a given action is taken by observing others making the same action, or just by observing the environment in the right circumstances. That is, we solve causal inference problems. This ability to learn from observation is one component of our sophisticated causal learning and reasoning abilities. I believe this ability is needed to create AI with a human-like sense of cause and effect relationships that is necessary to understand the world and the agent's place in it.

I am interested in theoretical work at the intersection between reinforcement learning and causal inference.

## Causal inference in computational neuroscience

I have worked on a diverse range of projects in computational neuroscience -- from neural data analysis of primary motor activity to computer vision problems related to neuron tracking in freely moving cnidaria (Hydra). I am interested in collaborating on any projects that . Before my doctoral studies, my interests were in systems biology and bioinformatics.
