## Causes and effects

Philosopher Bertrand Russell is known for his observation that the fundamental laws of physics contain no notion of cause and effect. The laws describe only correlations between physical quantities. A response is that this leaves causal relationships something that we project on to the world in order to make sense of our place within it and to control it. On this view causality is closely tied to our ability to see ourselves as agents in the world, free to act and to intervene on systems and to learn effects. Statisticians, and some philosophers, take this idea seriously -- a causal understanding of a system is an understanding of the effect of one's actions or, more generically, interventions on it.

## Causation in brains and machines

An agency-based/interventionist account of causation relates to many interesting questions in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. How do we learn from causal relations from our own actions, observing the actions of others, and from pure observation? Further, reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm that relates an agent's actions to a reward, inherently a causal learning task, yet flexible causal models of an environment are often lacking in contemporary AI agents trained through reinforcement learning and/or deep learning. What, exactly, are the limits of these methods to learn human-like causal models and reasoning abilities? What additional components may need to be 'innately' specified? Answering these questions requires both carefully characterizing the causal model-building capabilities of agents trained through reinforcement learning and/or deep learning, and understanding the mechanisms humans use for causal learning.
