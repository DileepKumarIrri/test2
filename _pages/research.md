Computational neuroscience is unique among areas of theoretical and quantitative biology for its emphasis on *representation* and *information processing* -- more than any other organ of our body, the brain *computes*.

Representations are apparent in sensory systems, where neural responses can be interpretted as encoding information about features of a visual scene, for example. Notions of representation in the primate motor system are less clear, and 

These issues of representation carry weight in the design of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), where it is possible that the successful implementation of any significantly powerful BMI  will rely on being able to properly *interpret the neural code*.



Below are more details of some projects I have worked on.
