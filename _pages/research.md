How do we learn causal relations in the world? How can AI perform the same causal reasoning tasks? The field of causal inference deals with how can the effect of interventions on the world be predicted from observation. Today, state of the art AI is trained via reinforcement learning, in which an agent learns directly from the consequences of its own actions -- it learns about causal relations direct from intervention. Yet humans (and arguably some primates) can also learn about what will happen 

I have worked on a diverse range of projects in computational neuroscience -- from neural data analysis of primary motor activity to computer vision problems related to neuron tracking in freely moving cnidaria (Hydra). My . Before my doctoral studies, my interests were in systems biology and bioinformatics.
