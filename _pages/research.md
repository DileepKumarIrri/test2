## Observational and causal learning

In short I am interested in the interesection of causal inference and reinforecement learning, both as statistics problems and as an account of how we (and other animals) may perform observational causal learning.

How do we learn causal relations in the world? How can methods in AI and machine learning perform causal reasoning in the same way we do? The field of *causal inference* deals with how the effect of *interventions* on the world can be predicted from *observation*. 

Today, most state-of-the-art AI agents are trained via reinforcement learning, in which an agent learns directly from the consequences of its own actions -- it learns about causal relations directly from intervention. Yet humans (and arguably some primates) can also learn about what will happen if a given action is taken by observing others making the same action, or just by observing the environment in the right circumstances. That is, we solve causal inference problems. This is one of the reasons we are better at causal learning and reasoning than most animals, and is one of the reasons AI today has a causally impoverished view of the world.

## Causal inference in neuroscience

More generally I am interested in developing causal inference methods that can be appied to neural datasets.

I have worked on a diverse range of projects in computational neuroscience -- from neural data analysis of primary motor activity to computer vision problems related to neuron tracking in freely moving cnidaria (Hydra). I am interested in collaborating on projects that provide causal explanations. Before my doctoral studies, my interests were in systems biology and bioinformatics.
