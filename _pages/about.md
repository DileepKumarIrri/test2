PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. 

I am working in statistical modeling and computational neuroscience with Professor Adrienne Fairhall. During my time in graduate school time I have enjoyed living in Seattle, but have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia.

As an undergraduate I studied mathematics at the University of Melbourne. My first experience with scientific research was in the bioinformatics division of the WEHI, as a part of the University of Melbourne’s UROP program. After this I completed an honours program joint between the WEHI and Melbourne University in computational gene prediction. I then continued to spend my time at the WEHI as a research assistant, developing tools for genomic tiling microarray data, and following this completed a Master’s of Philosophy (MPhil) in mathematical biology, again joint between the WEHI and Melbourne University.

Some interests that are not academic include hiking, biking, guitar playing and skiing.
