Here are some projects I have worked on, including code.

1. ethome -- DeepLabCut post-analysis package for animal behavior classification ([pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ethome-ml), [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/ethome))
2. ROI-decoder -- Streamlit app that computes a coarse estimate of stimuli tuning for calcium imaging data -- can be used in a semi-online fashion, during recording sessions to find responsive areas to to record further from ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/roi-decoder))
3. A Flask-based flight tracking web app ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/flying-overhead)), and a Flask-Ask based Alexa skill that uses local ADSB-receiver data so you can ask your Echo what planes are nearby. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/raspberry-fly))
4. TensorFlow code for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms for solving causal learning tasks ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/Meta-RL))
5. Implementations of common linear contextual bandit algorithms ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/conservativerdd))
6. Simple total variation image segmentation implemention ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/segmentation)) 
7. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. ([github](https://github.com/NeuroInfoPrimer/primer))
8. Simulation of reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/retinalwaves))
