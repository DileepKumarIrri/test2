Code related to projects I have been involved in.

1. Multi-agent behavior challenge -- classifying mouse behavior (run on AICrowd, [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/multi-agent-behavior-representation-modeling-measurement-and-applications)). I was awarded third place. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/mabetask1_ml)
2. Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms for solving causal learning tasks [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/Meta-RL)
3. Implementations of common linear contextual bandit algorithms [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/conservativerdd)
4. Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) network that learns using causal inference (regression discontinuity design). [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/rdd)
5. Simple total variation image segmentation implemention [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/segmentation) 
6. Generalized linear model (GLM) estimation and spike-train analysis, related to dual-control brain-computer interfaces. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/dualbci)
7. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/neuroinf)
8. Connectivity inference tools: Implements simple connectivity inference methods for GLM spike train analysis [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/connectivity)
9. Simulation of reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/retinalwaves)
