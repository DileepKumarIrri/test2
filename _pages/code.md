Code related to projects I have been involved in.

1. Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) network that learns using regression discontinuity design (RDD). [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/rdd)
2. Generalized linear model (GLM) estimation and spike-train analysis, related to dual-control brain-computer interfaces. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/dualbci)
3. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/neuroinf)
4. Connectivity inference tools: Implements simple connectivity inference methods for GLM spike train analysis [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/connectivity)
5. Simulation of reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/retinalwaves)
