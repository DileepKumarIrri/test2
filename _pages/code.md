Code related to projects I have been involved in.

1. A Flask-based flight tracking web app ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/flying-overhead)), and a Flask-Ask based Alexa skill that uses local ADSB-receiver data so you can ask your Echo what planes are nearby. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/raspberry-fly))
2. Third place winner multi-agent behavior challenge code -- Keras and Scikit-learn based mouse behavior classifier. Run by AICrowd, [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/multi-agent-behavior-representation-modeling-measurement-and-applications) [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/mabetask1_ml)
3. TensorFlow code for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms for solving causal learning tasks [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/Meta-RL)
4. Implementations of common linear contextual bandit algorithms [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/conservativerdd)
5. Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) network that learns using causal inference (regression discontinuity design). [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/rdd)
6. Simple total variation image segmentation implemention [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/segmentation) 
7. Generalized linear model (GLM) estimation and spike-train analysis, related to dual-control brain-computer interfaces. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/dualbci)
8. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/neuroinf)
9. Connectivity inference tools: Implements simple connectivity inference methods for GLM spike train analysis [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/connectivity)
10. Simulation of reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/retinalwaves)
