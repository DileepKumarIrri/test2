Code related to projects I have been involved in.

1. Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms for solving causal learning tasks [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/Meta-RL)
2. Implementations of common linear contextual bandit algorithms [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/conservativerdd)
3. Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) network that learns using causal inference (regression discontinuity design). [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/rdd)
4. Simple total variation image segmentation implemention [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/segmentation) 
5. Generalized linear model (GLM) estimation and spike-train analysis, related to dual-control brain-computer interfaces. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/dualbci)
6. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/neuroinf)
7. Connectivity inference tools: Implements simple connectivity inference methods for GLM spike train analysis [github](https://github.com/benlansdell/connectivity)
