I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Konrad Kording.

## Interests

I work in computational neuroscience and machine learning. I am interested in how we learn causal relations, and how machines can perform causal learning. 

## Bio

I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at UW in Seattle, under the supervision of Adrienne Fairhall. I have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia, completing a BSc with honours, majoring in mathematics, at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI). When I'm not researching I like exploring on bike (see some [photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/149922637@N08/)).
