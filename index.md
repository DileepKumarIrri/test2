I'm a machine learning engineer and research scientst with a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington. I have experience in computational neuroscience, AI, and bioinformatics. I develop novel machine learning and mathematical models of complex systems, particularly in the life sciences. I enjoy tackling challenging multidisciplinary problems to uncover scientific insights, and am passionate about building software tools to support and promote data science.

## Bio

I completed my PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle, under the supervision of Adrienne Fairhall, and pursued a postdoc with Konrad Kording at the University of Pennsylvania. I have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia, completing a BSc with honours, majoring in mathematics, at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI). When I'm not researching I enjoy touring the country by bike (see some [photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/149922637@N08/)). 

Also check out my notes on mathematics and physics: [Expositions](https://benlansdell.github.io/expositions/) -- an outlet for my interest in physics and mathematics not directly related to my work.
