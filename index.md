I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington.

## Interests
I work in statistical and computational neuroscience under the supervision of Professor Adrienne Fairhall. My interests are in the development of statistical methods for analyzing high-dimensional datasets provided by electrophysiological recording and optical imaging technologies, and the relation of this data to an organism's behavior. 

## Bio
I moved to Seattle for graduate school, where I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at UW. I have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia. I completed a BSc with honours, majoring in mathematics, at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI).
