I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. I'm expect to complete my PhD early next year.
## Interests
I work in statistical modeling and computational neuroscience under the supervision of Professor Adrienne Fairhall.

## Bio
I moved to Seattle for graduate school, but have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia. I completed a BSc with honours, majoring in Mathematics at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI).
