I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Konrad Kording.

## Interests

I work in statistical and computational neuroscience. I am interested in developing tools for causal inference in neuroscience, and in understanding how we and/or neural networks can solve causal inference problems. This is a broad project, and involves things like connectivity inference when stimulation data (interventions) are available, connections between reinforcement learning and causal inference, and viewing credit assignment in neural networks as a causal inference problem. 

## Bio

I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at UW in Seattle, under the supervision of Adrienne Fairhall. I have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia, completing a BSc with honours, majoring in mathematics, at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI).
