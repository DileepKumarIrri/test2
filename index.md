I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Konrad Kording. I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics from UW.

## Interests

I am a **computational scientist** and **applied mathematician** with an interest in **theoretical neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence**. I study how causality can provide better tools and models in both of these areas. This involves building models of how we can do causal learning, and how we combine methods from causal inference with machine learning to provide more efficient learning algorithms. By combining causal inference methods with developments in deep learning, I believe we can create smarter learning algorithms and better understand our own learning. My work thus involves a combination of statistics, computational modelling, systems neuroscience and tools from deep learning.

## Bio

I completed my PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle, under the supervision of Adrienne Fairhall. I have spent most of my life in or around Melbourne, Australia, completing a BSc with honours, majoring in mathematics, at the University of Melbourne. My interests then were in bioinformatics, which lead me to work as a research technician and then complete a Master's of Philosophy joint between the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI). When I'm not researching I like exploring on bike (see some [photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/149922637@N08/) or [trip reports](https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/directory/?user=lansdell)).
