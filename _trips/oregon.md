# Day 1.

Miles: 86.2

Caught early morning ferry from Seattle to Bremerton. Left Bremerton to ride to Montesanto (near Aberdeen). First leg followed Hood Canal, little traffic, quite scenic. Joined 101 and continued down to Shelton then onto Matlock and finally Montesanto.

The back roads via Matlock worked out great, very little traffic, flat. Mileage turned out to be a bit longer than anticipated... from my door to the campsite at Lake Sylvia State Park in Montesanto, so the first day was quite difficult. Should definitely have done more training rides. In fact, I didn't really do any. Finished the day exhausted. 

# Day 2 

Turns out the plan to ride from Montesanto to Astoria in one day was a bit ambitious. Indeed it would have totalled near 90 miles, making it the longest day on my itinerary. I woke up late with many aches in legs and back. So much so that I considered taking a 'rest day' after only the first day, given the milage ahead and my condition. However I slowly got myself moving and decided to see how far I could get in the day. Turns out today was the only day with rain, so overall I was quite lucky. Began the ride south on the 107 to Melbourne, then down on the 101 to Raymond. Soon after joining the 101 I noticed my rear wheel was rubbing against my brakes. I pulled over and realized the wheel was severly untrue. I started adjusting the spokes, when one snapped, quite easily. Probably, I realized, this was from damage I did to the spokes when overshifting the rear derailliurs when trying out different cassettes earlier in the week. I probably should have known I'd damaged them... pretty stupid. Not knowing how many other spokes were close to giving out, I didn't want to ride the bike any further. So was stuck half way between Raymond and Melbourne. The rain had ceased by then, at least. I eventually was able to hitch hike. I was picked up by an author/editor, Michael Mohr, who'd spent some months earlier in his life hitch hiking across the country. 

There may have been a bike store in Raymond, but I hitched all the way to Astoria. I figured this way I was sure to stay on schedule, and would have a (unplanned, but not entirely unwelcome) rest day. Had my bike fixed at 'Bike's and Beyond'. They were quick to fix up the spoke, and didn't charge me very much for the labor. Was quite happy. I made it to the Fort Stevens State Park outside Astoria by 5pm. After eating I had time to explore the park a little bit before dark. 

# Day 3

Having had a better night's sleep and an unplanned rest day yesterday, I felt in much better shape to continue on the trip on schedule. After reaching Astoria, the remainder of my route would follow the Adventure Cycling Pacific coast route. While
