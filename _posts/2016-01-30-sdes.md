[Here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pathintegrals_and_sdes.pdf) are my slides from the presentation I gave in the computational neuro journal club at UW. I attempt to summarize the path integral formulation used to derive higher order moments and PGFs for stochastic DEs.

* Based on: Path Integral Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations, C Chow and M Buice, 2012.
