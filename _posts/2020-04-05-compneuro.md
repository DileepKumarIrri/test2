[Here](https://benlansdell.github.io/compneurointro) are the slides for a talk I gave to the undergraduate student physics group at Western University. I introduce the basic questions and framing of the field of computational neuroscience. What separates the field from other areas of mathematical and theoretical biology is its emphasis on _computations_ of the brain. So these must be defined first, before going further.
