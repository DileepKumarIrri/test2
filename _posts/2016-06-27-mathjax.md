Integrating MathJax with Jekyll is a very convenient way of typesetting mathematics in a blog. There are many guides online, which were (almost) helpful in acheiving this on a github pages hosted site. The steps, as of June 2016, are:

1. Ensure markdown engine to `kramdown` in `_config.yml`. This is now the [only supported markdown processor](https://help.github.com/articles/updating-your-markdown-processor-to-kramdown/) on github pages, so this should be set anyway.
2. Include in a new file in `_includes` named `_mathjax_support.html`: (a clever idea from [here](http://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/)): 
    ```html
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
    jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],
    tex2jax: {
    inlineMath: [ ['$', '$'] ],
    displayMath: [ ['$$', '$$']],
    processEscapes: true,
    skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre', 'code']
    },
    messageStyle: "none",
    "HTML-CSS": { preferredFont: "TeX", availableFonts: ["STIX","TeX"] }
    });
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" async
    src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
    </script>
    ```
   Importantly, in contrast to older guides online, note the https in the MathJax CDN. Unencrypted access to the CDN is a security risk and now will either not render in some browsers (didn't work in Chrome for me), or will issue warnings in other browsers (Firefox). See the MathJax [documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html#secure-access-to-the-cdn) for more information.
3. Include in the `<head>` of `_layouts/default.html`:
    ```html
    {% if page.use_math %}
    {% include mathjax_support.html %}
    {% endif %}
    ```

Now to include $\latex$ in a post you just need set the variable `use_math: true` in the YAML front-matter of the page/post!
