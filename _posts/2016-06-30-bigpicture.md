The seeds for the philosophy presented in Sean Carroll's The Big Picture , what he dubs *Poetic Naturalism*, can be found in a small conference Carroll organized in 2011, named Moving Naturalism Forward. Since then Carroll has given a range of lectures, blog plots, and now written a book on the topic. At the three day conference Carroll gathered a collection of physicists, biologists and philosophers to discuss 'issues that are part of the naturalist program'. These include topics such as emergence, reality, morality, and meaning. The company present included Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Stephen Weinberg, and a host of other academics. It's full of heady discussion, some of which is decipherable, and some of which is a bit too laden in philosophy-speak to be comprehensible to the untrained. Nonetheless, the conference is full of some fascinating discussion and if you happen to find yourself with a free day or so I recommend watching the conference in its entirety ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju4C_ITlBsU])).

But let's take a step back and talk about what is naturalism, why these topics are of a concern to naturalists and what exactly is *poetic* naturalism. Naturalism can perhaps be most usefully defined in contrast to any philosophy or view that contains *supernatural* elements. The supernatural, in turn, includes gods, spirits, ghosts, demons, hidden forces. Naturalism denies the existence of any such things and so asserts that only the things that can be observed and studied by the scientific or other empirical methods constitute part of reality -- to paraphrase Carroll: there is only one world, and that world obeys natural laws we can discover. 

The topics covered are of a concern to, at the least, a physics-focused naturalist like Carroll. They are of interest because once supernatural phenomena are off the table it remains the task of naturalism to provide an account of what provides meaning to our lives, how we decide what is right and wrong, indeed how we decide on what exactly counts as a part of our reality -- our ontology. 

Arguably since the movement early last century known as logical positivism, science has had a tendency to be somewhat *eliminative* -- to explain away metaphysical concepts in terms of psychology, biology, chemistry, etc. A tendency for concepts like the soul and free-will to be discarded, thrown away as mere 'illusions'. More recently, the works of those like Dawkins, Hitchen and Harris has promoted a naturalistic picture of the world, a picture aggresively devoid of religion. The problem with such developments is that, if naturalism is ever to be adopted as a true alternative to a world-view that includes religion, there must be more therapy to accompany the eliminativism, lest the common accusation that atheists live in a spiritually devoid world ring true. Effort must be made to explain to a general audience how meaningful lives can be lead in purely material world -- what Owen Flannigan describes as the 'really hard problem'. 

Carroll's book is an attempt at addressing this problem.
