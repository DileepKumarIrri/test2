The seeds for Sean Carroll's philosophy, dubbed *Poetic Naturalism*, can be found in a small conference Carroll organized in 2011, named Moving Naturalism Forward. Since then Carroll has given a range of lectures, blog plots, and now written a book on the topic. At the three day conference Carroll gathered a collection of physicists, biologists and philosophers to discuss 'issues that are part of the naturalist program'. These include topics such as emergence, reality, morality, and meaning. The company present included Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Stephen Weinberg, and a host of other academics. It's full of heady discussion, some of which is decipherable, and some of which is a bit too laden in philosophy-speak to be comprehensible to the untrained. Nonetheless, the conference is full of some fascinating discussion and if you happen to find yourself with a free day or so I recommend watching the conference in its entirety (link). 

But let's take a step back and talk about what is naturalism, why these topics are of a concern to naturalists and what exactly is *poetic* naturalism. Naturalism can perhaps be most usefully defined in contrast to any philosophy or view that contains *supernatural* elements. The supernatural, in turn, includes gods, spirits, ghosts, demons, hidden forces. Naturalism denies the existence of any such things and so asserts that only the thigns that canbe observed and studied by the scientific or other empirical methods constitute part of reality -- to paraphrase Carroll: there is only one world, and that world obeys natural laws we can discover. 

The topics covered are of a concern to, at least a physics focused, naturalist like Carroll. These are of interest because, once supernatural phenomena are off the table, it remains the task of naturalism to provide an account of what is the meaning of our lives, how do we decide what is right and wrong. How do we give an account 

Now to Carroll's latest book, The Big Picture.
